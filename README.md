www.musilinks.com -
An interactive and visual web app that allows you to discover and play around with the relationships between artists and musical groups



**F.A.Q.**

**What is this?**

Musilinks is an interactive experience that allows you to find and play around with musical relationships
between different types of musical artists. <br> 

* You can explore bands you like to find who's in that band.
* You can expand the related artists of two different bands to find out what bands live in the intersection between them. 
* You can find new bands from your favorite artists that you didn't know they were a part of.
* ...And more

**How is this possible?**
Musilinks cross-references both MusicBrainz.org and Spotify's databases to provide its experience.

**Why some artists have a '?' instead of their pictures?**
This means that, even though MusicBrainz has information about this artist and we can expose his relationships, Spotify doesn't know about him. So, no Spotify profile is linked to this node.

**Why sometimes an artist node is not really him when I double click on it?**
We do our best to cross-reference the two databases, but sometimes a good link cannot be created, especially if there is more than 1 artist with exactly the same name. In future versions, we might fix that with the aid of our users.

**Can I contribute with information on artists?**
Sure! Head out to www.musicbrainz.org , create an account and start contributing!
